            <b>Hello and Welcome To My Page!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor's in Business Sustainability and is currently enrolled in University of Arizona's Coding Boot Camp. The reason being that I had an interest in coding and wanted to pursue a career that wasn't Sales or Management. I prefer hands-on activites where I am able to see through the whole project from beginning to end. While I am still a beginner in learning the concept of coding, I am very excited to see what I will be able to do in the next couple of months!
